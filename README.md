<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project was created as part of a group project during the intensive 11-week Angular course at [Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/).

A serverless application, supporting three distinct user roles and providing wide range of functionality:

* Anonymous Users: Search for routes and view trip details (authorization required for booking).
* Authorized Users: Book trips, access booking history, and manage user profiles.
* Resource Managers: Perform administrative tasks, including managing routes, schedules, stations, carriages, and rides, deleting users' accounts.

The application consists of the following pages:
## User pages

* Registration page
* Login page
* User Profile page
* Search page includes trip details
* Order page

## Manager pages
* Admin overview
* Stations management
* Carriages/Cars management
* Route management including Ride management

### Manager credentials

> The manager and the root administrator can enter the system with  
> _email:_ <admin@admin.com>  
> _password:_ my-password

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

<p> <a href="https://angular.io"><img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=angular" /></a> The application is built using the Angular framework, leveraging its features such as Routing, Reactive Forms, Directives, Pipes, Signals and so on. It employs both modules and standalone components to create a robust and maintainable architecture. </p> 
<p><a href="https://ngrx.io/">NgRx</a> library is used for managing the application's state, utilizing actions, reducers, selectors, and effects to handle state changes efficiently.</p>
<p><a href="https://rxjs.dev/">RxJS</a> library is used for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.</p> 
<p><a href="https://primeng.org/">PrimeNG</a> UI Component library is used for enhancing the user interface with a wide range of customizable components.</p>
